# What is a model?

"All models are wrong, but some are useful" **George Box - British Statistician**

Thoughts?

# Why Model?

Models give us a way to look at the world through a mixture of data and theory.

A good model can help us to understand how the world works and how decisions that we make might change the world in ways that are important to us.

Useful when there is something you need to **know** in order to solve the problem

# Why Model?

Answer to a question

-   What if?
-   How Much?
-   Which Alternative?
-   Why is this happening?

Test a Hypothesis

# Models are always simplifications

[Simple Box](images/image2-01.png)

Globe: Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage

$P = ET + ΔS$

Watershed: Precipitation = Evapotranspiration + Change in Storage + Streamflow

$P = ET + ΔS + Q$

You are using models all the time - you just don't know it!

# Model Goals

Because models are only approximations of reality - the most important part of the modelling process is knowing **why** you want to build a model

# Model Goals

Some broad types of goals

-   *Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

-   *Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment, what might the environment look like if something changes)

-   *Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding

Actual goal(s) needs to be more precisely defined

# Models for understanding

What are "big" \#'s, "little" \#'s as controls on phenomena

The is often the role of *inverse inference* models - for example using a GCM to assess whether CO2 emissions can explain trends in warming temperature

This application of models is often in the form of a question

# Example of Model for Understanding

In a particular place (Baltimore Harbor),

Would temperature often be a limiting factor in eutrophication?

At what times of year, would N-export matter?

# Models for estimation and what if scenarios

[IPCC Projections](http://narccap.ucar.edu/about/figures/IPCCProjections.jpg)

Estimate of global temperatures over the next 100 years

# Models for estimation

[Estimate of energy savings from LED adoption](http://www.lightnowblog.com/2014/10/forecasted-energy-savings-from-led-lighting/)

# Models can also be for communication

Goal: Help public understand why, even if temperature warms - glaciers might grow (due to increasing snowfall) - but a threshold temperature might be reached where glacier will shrink

# Model Goals

*Understanding* (how does something work, what are key drivers of responses, how do different drivers interact)

*Estimation/Scenario* (what might be the consequences of decisions we make about the environment)

*Communication* - contribute to education and broader understanding

# For Next Class

1.  Fill out *Help us get to know you* survey on *Canvas*

2.  Listen to *only* timestap 26:27 to 31:22 (basically 5 minutes) of the following blog by Lisa Felman Barrett - a highly cited psychologist

[blog 26:27 to 31:22](https://youtu.be/NbdRIVCBqNI?t=1587)

3.  After listening to the podcast, do the following

Think about what an inverse inference problem might be in the context of the environment

# And complete coding check
4.  Code a function

In this course, we will work a lot with writing and applying functions; You've all been exposed to writing functions in previous courses - but just to make sure that everyone remembers the basic syntax in R, complete the following:

---

Write a function that computes energy produced from a photovoltaic system if you know the average annual solar radiation. You can use the following formula:


$E = A * r * H * PR$

-   E is energy (kWh),
-   A is the solar panel area (m2)
-   r is panel yield (0-1) (manufacture efficiency - usually around 0.2),
-   PR is performance ratio (0-1) (accounting for site factors that impact efficiency usually around 0.75)
-   H is annual average solar radiation (kWh)

---

Write your function in R; make sure that you add documentation; include default values for *r* and *PR* in the function definition; save the function in a single file to upload to Canvas. 


# To summarize 

Submit on Canvas the following by 8am April 3th:

1.  Fill out 'get to know you' survey on Canvas
2.  A single R file that implements the solar energy yield function (on Canvas)
3.  Be ready to discuss a conceptual model that might be used to solve an inverse inference problem in class
