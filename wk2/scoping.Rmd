## More details on scoping

R operates in various **environments** which are basically the memory spaces that contain all your variables, datasets/frames/tables and functions. In computer science, an "environment" is also known as a **namespace** (i.e. memory space for all named things). To quote the wikipedia article on [namespace](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/tufte-quotes.html):

> In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.

At the top level, R operates in what is known as the *global namespace* or *global envionrment*. When you try and reference a variable, datset or function, R will search within the **scope** or **context** of this namespace. The global environment, function namespace, and package namespace are three common namespaces that you will encounter. To quote from the same article:

> A namespace name may provide context (scope in computer science) to a name, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the context of a name may also be provided by other factors, such as the location where it occurs or the syntax of the name.

Let's see an example:

```{r cars}
my_global_var = 10
my_Global_var = 20

# print it out
my_global_var
my_Global_var

# see what variables are in your R environment
ls()
```

You can see this on the right hand side of RStudio under the "Environment" tab. Both `my_global_var` and `my_Global_var` are in your global environment. Names are **always unique within a namespace** and **case sensitive**, and therefore these are treated as two different variables.

## A detailed example of how scoping works with functions

Naomi showed this in class, but I thought it might help to look at it with another example. Let's create a simple **inline** function (i.e. it's created within a chunk or script, and not a separate standalone function) and see how variable scoping behaves in the function and global namespaces.

```{r}
my_func = function(a, b) {
  c = a+b
  return(c)
}
```

Note that your function has appeared in the global environment on the right hand side pane (or you can use `ls()` in the R console). Let's use the function.

```{r}
my_func (my_global_var, my_Global_var) #result should be 30 if you haven't changed those variables
```

Note that neither a, b or c are in your global environment. You cannot access their values from the console or the rest of the script/rmd/qmd -- they are **local** to the scope of your function's namespace. They don't exist outside of it.

```{r}
ls()
```

But can the function "see" outside? Let's make a "bad" function that tries to use things in the global environment that it can't be sure exist:

```{r}
my_bad_func = function(a) {
  c = a + my_Global_var
  return(c)
}

#let's try it out -- with an input of 5 I should get 25
my_bad_func(5)

#if I delete my_Global_var from the global namespace, the function fails
rm(my_Global_var)

# run again -- comment the below line if you want this to render/knit successfully
 my_bad_func(5)

# you will get an error
# Error in my_bad_func(5) : object 'my_Global_var' not found
```

This is BAD. Don't do this, it can lead to unexpected behaviour, errors, etc.

But remember, the names are unique to each namespace and the most local namespace has precedence, so within a function the function's names will have priority. For example:

```{r}
my_fixed_func = function(a) {
  my_global_var = 100
  c = a + my_global_var
  return(c)
}

paste0("In the global environment, my_global_var = ", my_global_var)

#let's try it out -- with an input of 35 I should get 135
my_fixed_func(35)
```

In the above case, it uses the internal value of `my_global_var` instead of the global one. So it is "safe" in this way to have a function namespace variable that has the same name as a global namespace variable, although of course it may become confusing for the reader, but that is a separate matter.

## Example of package namespaces

So how do namespaces work with packages? If you type `help("library")`, you can see how this works:

> `library(package)` and `require(package)` both load the namespace of the package with name `package` and attach it on the search list. `require` is designed for use inside other functions; it returns `FALSE` and gives a warning (rather than an error as `library()` does by default) if the package does not exist.

Basically, loading a package adds the package namespace to the list of loaded package namespaces, through which R will search when you try and use (i.e. "call") a function. It doesn't actually load all the functions etc. of a package into your global environment, and as was mentioned in class, functions in your environment have precedence over those in attached package namespaces. (so be careful!)

However, you can still call functions from packages without loading them, if you have them installed and use the scoping operator

Let's use the package `dplyr` as an example to demonstrate this.

```{r}
#create a data frame
my_df = data.frame(day = seq(1,30), Tavg = runif(30, 15, 20))

#print the first few lines to check
head(my_df)

#use dplyr function called mutate without loading the library but referencing the correct namespace
#the format is package::function or package::data
my_df = dplyr::mutate(my_df, precip = runif(30, 0, 10))

head(my_df)

#the other way of doing it of course is the usual library() call
library(dplyr)

my_df = mutate(my_df, wind=runif(30, 0, 50))

#print last few lines for fun
tail(my_df)
```

I hope this might have been helpful!
